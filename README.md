# Polymer-Compatibility

Model

We present our Half Dense Difference Network (HDDN) in this folder. The training and test code is included in HDDN.py. Main results of HDDN in our paper is presented in HDDN Result folder. We also conduct HSP chemistry method on our database. The code and results are presented in HSP folder.

Text Data Mining (TDM)

TDM is important for us to design an information extraction module. Firstly, we use data with labels to train the classifier and achieve over 90% accuracy. Based on this classifier, we put all sentences through the classifier and get thousands of compatibility-relative ones.

Method

The details of our method is presented in our Supplement.pdf.
